Engineering is inherently messy work. Sometimes your prototype violently
explodes, tossing parts across the workspace. In most of my experiments,
today's workspace is virtual &mdash; but I often destroy development
environments, especially when dealing with dodgy tools.

This repository contains scripts to help aleviate the pain associated with
restoring editor and other environmental configuration.
